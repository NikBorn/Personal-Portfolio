        I am coming into the tech industry after a successful career in Marketing and Management.  I graduated from 
        the University of Colorado with a BS in Business with an emphasis in Marketing.  I've held many different job
        titles in the past including: Manager, Director of Marketing, Practice Manager for a speech therapy practice,
        Licensing Manager, Delivery Manager, and Product Designer.
        <br /><br />
        I am very excited to enter a new chapter of my life by starting out in a completly new field.  I recently
        graduated from Turing School of Software and Design in Denver, CO with a certificat of completion from their
        front-end developer program.  Besides learning valuable skills like time and stress management as well as
        personal and coloaborative, project management; I also learned HTML5, Javascript(Echmascript6), CSS3, React,
        React-Redux and Express.js.
        <br /><br />
        I'm looking to join a collaborative team environment, that will also offer me a path to advancement.  I am 
        very coachable and someone who enjoys furthering my education as well as teaching others the skils and techniques
        that I've picked up along the way.
