        I am coming into the tech industry after a successful career in Marketing and Management.  I graduated from 
        the University of Colorado with a BS in Business with an emphasis in Marketing.  I have held many different job
        titles in the past including: Manager, Director of Marketing, Practice Manager for a speech therapy practice,
        Licensing Manager, Delivery Manager, and Product Designer.
        <br />
        <br />
        I am very excited to enter a new chapter of my life by starting out in a completely new field.  I recently
        graduated from Turing School of Software and Design in Denver, CO with a certificate of completion from their
        front-end developer program.  Besides learning valuable skills like time and stress management as well as
        personal and collaborative project management; I am also knowledgeable in HTML5, Javascript(ES6), CSS3, 
        React, React-Redux and Express.js.
        <br />
        <br />
        I am looking to join a collaborative team environment that will also offer me an opportunity for advancement. 
        I am very coachable and someone who enjoys furthering my education as well as teaching others the skills and 
        techniques that I have picked up along the way.
